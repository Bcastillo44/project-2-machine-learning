# Project 2 Draft Proposal

## Title: Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading Model Evaluation

## Team Members

1. Bryan Castillo
1. Andrew Mui
1. Yao Kouassi

## Summary

Goal: Use machine learning models to determine if financial fundamental data correlates with stock sector performance.

Method: Evaluate several machine learning models to utilize time series data and data on financial fundamentals to determine the most profitable machine learning model, and to evaluate it's performance going forward. Also, we will use a comparative study of two selected sectors to determine if our data analysis is more strongly correlated to one sector.

Hypothesis: Our financial fundamental data analysis will correlate strongly with one sector vs. the other.

## Research Questions

1. Will our portfolio performance reveal financial fundamental metrics can be used to predict stock performance?

1. Using business fundamental financial statement data including income statements, balance sheet statements, and cash flow statements, which sector will perform best (i.e. tech vs. financials)?

1. Can we predict a percentage return range based on our model performance?

## Data Availability

1. Quandl API

2. Publically available data from historical financial statements on company websites

3. Financial Modeling Prep API

## Needs and Assumptions on Data

1. Daily data vs monthly/quarterly data?
1. How difficult is it to find the fundamental data needed?
1. Can we find daily fundamental data?
1. Will a longer timeframe dataset offer the same clarity as a shorter dataset?

## Breakdown of Tasks

1. Pull data from the various sources.
1. Clean Data using Pandas and Jupyter notebook.
1. Perform analysis on model to choose which stocks to invest in.
1. Based on model outcome, use model to predict stock price/ROI.
1. Use model to test performance of portfolio stock choices.
