# Project 2 Draft Proposal

## Title: Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading Model Evaluation

## Team Members

1. Bryan Castillo
1. Andrew Mui
1. Yao Kouassi

## Summary

Build the best possible model to utilize time series data analysis and financial fundamental metrics to maximize stock portfolio performance.

## Research Questions

1. Using business fundamental financial statement data including income statements, balance sheet statements, and cash flow statements, which sector will perform best (i.e. tech vs. financials)?

1. Will our portfolio performance reveal financial fundamental metrics can be used to predict sector performance?

1. How would this compare to a baseline investment fund such as S&P500 or Treasury bonds?

1. Can we create a percentage return range based on the model performance?

## Data Availability

1. Quandl dataset

2. Publically available data from historical financial statements on company websites

3. Financial Modeling Prep API

## Needs and Assumptions on Data

1. Daily data vs monthly/quarterly data?
1. How difficult is it to find the fundamental data needed?
1. Can we find daily fundamental data?
1. Will a longer timeframe dataset offer the same clarity as a shorter dataset?

## Breakdown of Tasks

1. Pull data from the various sources.
1. Clean Data using Pandas and Jupyter notebook.
1. Perform analysis on model to choose which stocks to invest in.
1. Based on model outcome, use second model to predict stock price/ROI.
1. Use final model to test performance of portfolio stock choices.
