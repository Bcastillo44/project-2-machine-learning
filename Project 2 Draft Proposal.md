# Project 2 Draft Proposal

## Title: Machine Learning Algorithmic Trading Model Evaluation

## Team Members

1. Bryan Castillo
1. Andrew Mui
1. Yao Kouassi

## Summary

This project will use business fundamental financial statement data to evaluate which model will perform best on the historical data collected.

## Research Questions

1. Which machine learning model, based on historical business financial statement data collected, will best predict stock price movement to maximize portfolio return performance.

## Data Availability

1. Quandl dataset - currently pay for data.

2. Publically available data from historical financial statements.

## Needs and Assumptions on Data

1. Daily data vs monthly/quarterly data?
1. How difficult is it to find the fundamental data datapoints needed?
1. Can we find daily fundamental data?
1. Will a longer timeframe dataset offer the same clarity as a shorter dataset?

## Breakdown of Tasks

1. Pull data from the various sources.
1. Clean Data using Pandas and Jupyter notebook.
1. Perform analysis with the data and choose model.
